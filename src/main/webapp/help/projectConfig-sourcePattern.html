    When a path is matched against a pattern, the following special characters can be used:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>?</tt>
            <br>
            Matches one character (any character except path separators)
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>*</tt>
            <br>
            Matches zero or more characters (not including path separators)
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>**</tt>
            <br>
            Matches zero or more path segments
        </li>
    </ul>

    Examples:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>**/*.js</tt>
            <br>
            Matches all .js files/dirs in a directory tree
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>node_modules/**</tt>
            <br>
            Matches the node_modules folder and all its contents
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>test/a??.js</tt>
            <br>
            Matches all files/dirs which start with an <tt>a</tt>, then two more characters and then <tt>.js</tt>,
            in a directory called test
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>**</tt>
            <br>
            Matches everything in a directory tree
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>**/test/**/XYZ*</tt>
            <br>
            Matches all files/dirs which start with <tt>XYZ</tt> and where there is a parent directory called
            <tt>test</tt> (e.g. <tt>abc/test/def/ghi/XYZ123</tt>)
        </li>
    </ul>
